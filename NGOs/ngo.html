                        We endeavour to implement the Government of India’s PM POSHAN Initiative (formerly the Mid-Day Meal Scheme) to solve at scale 
                        the overarching societal issues of classroom hunger and malnutrition in the country.It is our firm belief that investing in 
                        child nutrition and education is one of the most effective entry points for human development. Driven by this belief, we strive 
                        to provide children with a hot, nutritious and tasty mid-day meal every school day as an incentive to come to school. Thus, the 
                        vision – ‘No child in India shall be deprived of education because of hunger.’

                        neglected issues of the financially and materially poor, involving them in designing and implementing their own 
                        solutions, with their own efforts, knowledge, and dignity, and material as a reward for their participation.
